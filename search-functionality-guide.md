# Query Search Functionality Guide

## ‚úÖ **Safe Search Implementation**

The search functionality has been added **without affecting** any existing features:

### **Search Features:**
- üîç **Simple search box** below the summary chart
- **Real-time filtering** - results update as you type
- **Clear button** - appears when searching
- **Results counter** - shows "Showing X of Y queries"
- **Auto-scroll** - automatically scrolls to first matching result
- **Escape key** - press Escape to clear search

### **How to Use:**
1. Type in the search box (e.g., "carbide", "gripper", "jergens")
2. Queries are filtered in real-time
3. Click "Clear" or press Escape to reset

### **Existing Features Still Work:**
‚úÖ **Clickable stat cards** - Click on numbers to see product lists
‚úÖ **Product tables with SKU** - All product details remain visible
‚úÖ **Interactive charts** - All visualizations work normally
‚úÖ **Show/hide animations** - Smooth transitions still function

### **Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `query-hidden` class instead of modifying existing classes
- Separate JavaScript functions (`searchQueries`, `clearSearch`)
- Doesn't interfere with existing event listeners
- Isolated search logic that won't affect click handlers

### **Testing:**
1. Search for "carbide" ‚Üí Only carbide queries show
2. Click on "25 Expected Products" ‚Üí Product list still appears
3. Clear search ‚Üí All queries reappear
4. Click on stat cards while searching ‚Üí Both features work together

The search is completely isolated and safe!
